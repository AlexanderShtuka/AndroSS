Building AndroSS requires running jni/genAndroSSNative.pl to ensure that the
external binary used on rooted devices ends up where the app expects to find it.
The Eclipse project metadata will mostly take care of this, but unless you and I
have a great deal in common, you will at least need to update the PATH the
native builder is run with.
